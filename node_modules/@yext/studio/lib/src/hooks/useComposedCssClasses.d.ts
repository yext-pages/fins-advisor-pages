/**
 * useComposedCssClasses merges a component's built-in tailwind classes with custom tailwind classes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Tailwind classes will be merged without conflict, with custom classes having higher priority
 * than built-in ones.
 *
 * @example
 * Suppose a component has built-in classes of `{ container: 'px-4 text-slate-700' }`.
 *
 * Passing in the custom classes:
 *
 * ```ts
 * { container: 'text-red-200 mb-3' }
 * ```
 *
 * results in the merged classes of:
 *
 * ```ts
 * { container: 'px-4 text-red-200 mb-3' }
 * ```
 *
 * @public
 *
 * @param builtInClasses - The component's built-in tailwind classes
 * @param customClasses - The custom tailwind classes to merge with the built-in ones
 * @returns The composed CSS classes
